# Semantic Property Task: annotation

This repository contains code to create input for an annotation task. In this task, property-concept pairs should be annotated with semantic relations. The property-concept pairs were collected from various resources (https://github.com/cltl/semantic_property_dataset).


## Annotation task

The annotation task is set up as follows: Participants are presented with short descriptions of a relation between a property and a concept and asked to indicate whether they agree or disagree with the description.
